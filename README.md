 ECCE App Challenge

## Mission/App Statement:


### Our web app centers a case study of Business Improvement Areas (BIAs) implemented throughout the City of Toronto to explore how businesses and neighborhood residents reciprocally shape each other’s wellbeing. BIAs are created by commercial owners to promote business in a neighborhood by adding a tax levy that will fund city-led initiatives and programs. Toronto was the first in the world to implement this system in 1970 with the Bloor West Village BIA. Now, over 60,000 of these areas have been created in municipalities across the globe (Charenko, 2015). At its core, the BIA system surrounds businesses supporting businesses, with residential and non-commercial wellbeing of the neighborhood is an external factor. We focus on a set of socioeconomic indicators to assess the impacts of a designated BIA on the city’s commercial and residential metabolisms. This aims to assess the impacts of BIAs on the neighbourhood at large, interrogating both the efficacy of the BIA to support businesses and whether non-commercial residents are benefitted by these groups.
### Our app, BIAdvocate: Toronto, encapsulates an interaction with several map layers to explore the creation and spread of the BIA program within Toronto’s CMA while accounting for the socioeconomic impact it has on locals. This application explores the coexistence of private entities and residents within the urban landscape, highlighting the tension in municipal support of commercial and residential livelihoods.


## How to use our app:


### The BIA and Neighbourhood Identifier tool can be used to explore the identities of both Toronto’s neighborhoods and commercial BIAs. The time slider at the bottom allows the user to observe the creation of BIAs overtime. Individual BIAs can be selected, populating the window on the right with information about the BIA and its surrounding community. This button toggles a sidebar widget containing charts showing neighbourhood demographic information. When a neighbourhood is selected on the map, the charts are populated with values. Working together, these tools allow the user to develop an understanding of Toronto’s neighbourhoods, and how those neighbourhoods led to the creation of BIAs.



### Next, the find a BIA tool allows the user to scroll and explore the list of Toronto’s BIAs as well as search for a specific BIA in the search bar. Images link to the external site of the BIA.



### The socioeconomic variable visualizer explores how income, employment, population, housing affordability, and housing standards fluctuate overtime to assess the success of BIAs in encouraging economic growth and its impacts on local resident livelihoods. Layers can be toggled on and off and reordered via the map layer button in the upper bar with an associated legend. A search function is located in the same upper bar to locate and zoom to relevant BIA zones. These functionalities can be used to assess how trends in each variable change throughout the years of 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, and 2021.
