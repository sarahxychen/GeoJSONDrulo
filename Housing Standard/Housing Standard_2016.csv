Notes
% of Households in Core Housing Need = Households in Core Housing Need / Households Tested for Core Housing Need
"Data include all non-farm, non-band, non-reserve private households reporting positive incomes and shelter cost-to-income ratios less than 100 per cent."
"A household is in core housing need if its housing does not meet one or more standards for housing adequacy (repair), suitability (crowding), or affordability and if it would have to spend 30 per cent or more of its before-tax income to pay the median rent (including utilities) of appropriately sized alternative local market housing. Adequate housing does not require any major repairs, according to residents. Suitable housing has enough bedrooms for the size and make-up of resident households. Affordable housing costs less than 30 per cent of before-tax household income."
"Affordable housing costs less than 30 per cent of before-tax household income. Includes households below more than one standard (in addition to the affordability standard). Accordingly, the sum of the number of households below each standard will be larger than the total number of households below standards."
"Adequate housing does not require any major repairs, according to residents. Includes households below more than one standard (in addition to the adequacy standard). Accordingly, the sum of the number of households below each standard will be larger than the total number of households below standards."
"Suitable housing has enough bedrooms for the size and make-up of resident households. Includes households below more than one standard (in addition to the suitability standard). Accordingly, the sum of the number of households below each standard will be larger than the total number of households below standards."
